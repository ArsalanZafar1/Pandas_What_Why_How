It is built on top of  NumPy (another python library)which is a multidimensional array with a only homogeneous elements. While Pandas is designed to work with **heterogeneous data** with rows and columns. It works with tabular, textual, also time-series data. Its function and structure are similar to an spreadsheet or SQL tables.\n","\n","Pandas has two data structures, **Series** and **Dataframe** which we will review in detail. \n","\n","Why should we learn Pandas?\n","\n","Pandas is fast , flexible and effcient in analyzing data from various sources and it is open source. Pandas can be run on your desktop and in the cloud for faster computing power. It is the top choice for data scientists and there is a large Pandas community to lean on. Pandas was born from python and this aspect gives it a massive reach into the type of data sources and capabilities you can build around your data analysis. \n","\n","How are we going to achieve the learning goal?\n","\n","This article is for all levels, It focuses on the basics of Python Pandas:\n","\n","1.
